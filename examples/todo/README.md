This example demonstrates how to work with more complex canisters, identities, canister upgrades, and stable memory management.

Start DFX:

```shell
dfx start --background
```

Create a new canister:

```shell
bun create:todo
```

Build the counter canister:

```shell
bun build:todo
```

Run the counter tests:

```shell
bun test:todo
```
